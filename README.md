# My Teamtreehouse techdegree project 1

This is my first project for the Teamtreehouse Fullstack JavaScript techdegree.

Used technologies: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

The goal was to display a quote/source/citation/year randomly from an array of objects and change the backgroundcolor of the page to a random generated color to.

The HTML and CSS files are provided by Treehouse, but the JS files are self writen.
